# Instructions
As a magician-to-be, Elyse needs to practice some basics. She has a stack of cards that she wants to manipulate.

To make things a bit easier she only uses the cards 1 to 10 so her stack of cards can be represented by an array of numbers. The position of a certain card corresponds to the index in the array. That means position 0 refers to the first card, position 1 to the second card etc.


## Task 1: Retrieve a Card from the Stack
- Create a variable named `position` for the index of the card you want to retrieve.
- Create a variable named `getItemResult` and set it to the value at index `position` of the `stack` array.


## Task 2: Exchange a Card in the Stack
- Create a variable named `replacementCard` for the new card value to insert.
- Replace the value in the `stack` array at the specified `position` with `replacementCard`.


## Task 3: Insert a Card at the Top of the Stack
- Create a variable named `newCardTop` for the new card value to insert at the top.
- Insert `newCardTop` at the beginning of the `stack` array.


## Task 4: Remove a Card from the Stack
- Remove the card at the specified `position` from the `stack` array.


## Task 5: Remove the Top Card from the Stack
- Remove the card at the beginning (index 0) of the `stack` array.


## Task 6: Insert a Card at the Bottom of the Stack
- Create a variable named `newCardBottom` for the new card value to insert at the bottom.
- Insert `newCardBottom` at the end of the `stack` array.


## Task 7: Remove a Card from the Bottom of the Stack
- Remove the card at the end of the `stack` array.


## Task 8: Check the Size of the Stack
- Create a variable named `stackSize` for the size you want to check.
- Create a variable named `checkSizeOfStackResult` and set it to `true` if the length of the `stack` array equals `stackSize`, otherwise set it to `false`.
