# Fun With Numbers

In this exercise, you will use variables and expressions to help with Kojo's number games.  

## Task 1: Calculate the Sum for the Slot Machine

- There are two groups of digits, each represented as an array (e.g. `[1, 7, 3]`).
- Each array represents a number (e.g. `[1, 7, 3]` is 173).
- **Declare variables named `digits1` and `digits2`** for the two arrays.
- **Declare a variable named `number1`** for the number represented by `digits1`.
- **Declare a variable named `number2`** for the number represented by `digits2`.
- **Declare a variable named `twoSum`** for the sum of `number1` and `number2`.


## Task 2: Determine if a Number is a Palindrome
- A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g. 12321).
- **Declare a variable named `luckyInput`** for the number to check.
- **Declare a variable named `luckyInputStr`** for the string version of `luckyInput`.
- **Declare a variable named `luckyNumber`** and set it to `true` if `luckyInput` is a palindrome, otherwise `false`.


## Task 3: Generate an Error Message for Invalid User Input
- User input is always a string, or it may be empty, undefined, or null.
- **Declare a variable named `userInput`** for the userâ€™s input.
- **Declare a variable named `errorMessage`** for the error message.
  - If the input is undefined, null, or an empty string, set `errorMessage` to `'Required field'`.
  - If the input does not represent a non-zero number, set `errorMessage` to `'Must be a number besides 0'`.
  - Otherwise, set `errorMessage` to an empty string.
