# Instructions
In this exercise, you will write some code to help you prepare to buy a vehicle.

You have three tasks, one to determine if you will need to get a license, one to help you choose between two vehicles and one to estimate the acceptable price for a used vehicle.

## Task 1: Determine if you need a driver’s license

- Use a variable named `kind` for the type of vehicle (e.g., `"car"`, `"truck"`, `"bike"`).
- Use a variable named `needsLicenseResult` to store `true` if a license is needed, or `false` otherwise.


## Task 2: Choose between two potential vehicles to buy

- Use variables named `option1` and `option2` for the names of the two vehicles.
- Use a variable named `chooseVehicleResult` to store the option (as a string) that comes **first in dictionary order**, followed by `" is clearly the better choice."`


## Task 3: Calculate an estimation for the price of a used vehicle

- Use a variable named `originalPrice` for the initial price of the vehicle.
- Use a variable named `age` for the vehicle’s age in years.
- Use a variable named `calculateResellPriceResult` to store the estimated resell price based on these conditions:
  - If the vehicle is **less than 3 years old**, the result is **80%** of the original price.
  - If the vehicle is **more than 10 years old**, the result is **50%** of the original price.
  - If the vehicle is **at least 3 years old but not older than 10 years**, the result is **70%** of the original price.
